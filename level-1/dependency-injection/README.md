Level 1 - Exercise Dependency Injection

**Objectives**
Imagine you are about to leave home to go to school/work. Before leaving home, you will need to take your wallet, house keys, perhaps your car/motorcycle keys or public transport card, and your smartphone.
Write a program that simulates this logic using the dependency injection pattern.
